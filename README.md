# Diversifying Open Source

We are a community of open source evangelists who believe in encouraging and celebrating underrepresented people in open source.

Through our series of meetups, mini hackathons and public speaking workshops we support underrepresented people in contributing to foss projects and speaking at open source conferences.

This is an experimental project and will be active from December 2017 to December 2018. We are based out of Bangalore, India and will organize meetups once in a month for the duration of a project. Look out this space for the meetup details.
